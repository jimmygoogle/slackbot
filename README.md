# slackbot

This is a small node.js app that will answer time and location questions to a specified Slack bot and return the response to the user. It uses Wit to figure out the intent and possible location to get the time.
This is based on a LinkedIn learning (https://www.linkedin.com/learning/node-js-build-your-first-microservice) exercise I followed.

Ex:

Jim [4:43 PM]

jimbot APP [4:43 PM]
In costa rica, it is now Monday, June 4th 2018, 2:43:47 pm
